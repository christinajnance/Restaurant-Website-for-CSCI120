				<h2> History </h2>
				<p>
					In highschool, Christina was in the Science and Technology
					Program where she fell in love with Computer Science and coding. 
					As a result, she decided to pursue a dual degree in Computer Science
					and Information Technology to learn the technical and cyber security side
					of computers. She aspires to one work for the FBI in their cyber crime division
					as a computer forensics analyst. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In her first semester at Coastal Carolina University, she took Interface to
					Web Interface Development where she created this webpage with her favorite foods.
					If you know Christina, you know she loves to eat so this page suites her well. From
					food lover to fellow food lover, we hope this page fits your need and satisfies 
					your desires.

		<div id="colorScheme">
			<p><img src="images/rectangular.gif" alt="Color Scheme"></p>
			<p>I chose the Tetradic (Rectangular) Color Scheme because 
			I am a fan of color. I also think I needed at least four colors
			to differentiate the various sections on each web page I had. 
			Blue represents the main content while green specifies the different
			dishes. Orange is navigations and pink represents the beginning and end 
			of each web page. My webpage is built around food. A dish consists of multiple
			ingredients that all come together as a whole. My color scheme represents a dish as well. 
			Together, all four colors harmonize and become one. They aren't as good on there own
			but together they create something beautiful. </p>
