# Restaurant-Website-for-CSCI120
I created this website during my freshman year where I was tasked with creating a website for my own restaurant using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Each branch represents a new file in my directory that contains the decorative elements of the website such as CSS styling, images, videos, etc. 
All .html files under main are the different website pages with the index.html representing the home page.
